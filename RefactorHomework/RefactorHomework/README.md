# Refactor Homework

### About
The Refactor homework allows you to exercise your skills of refactoring/simplifying complicated code in an existing infrastructure without breaking the original behavior.

### Instructions
This homework comes in 2 flavors: [Java](java/README.md) and [NodeJS](nodejs/README.md).
Each flavor has it's own named directory and includes a README with instructions tailored for that flavor.
Choose the one you're most comfortable with and open the corresponding README.md to get started.
